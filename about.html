        <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
        <img src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="About Image">
        <p>We were founded when the secret aliens hiding in Area 51 were introduced to Thai food. The food they created was so good that the rest of the military base decided to let them start selling it. The general public was not even concerned with the existence of aliens being revealed, as the food was just too good!</p>
